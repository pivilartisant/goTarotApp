# spookyTarot

This is a little web app I made for halloween 2022. 

The data used comes from a rws tarot deck I found on Kaggle. 
All the scripts, data parsing, data formating and animations are written in vanilla javascript :) 

It was a good challenge for me to code this, but I definitely learned a lot while doing so ! 

If you enjoy my work spread the word, i'm open for commissions :)
